Command line demo of an rpg concept

To do:

-help, info commands
-name input
-unit tests?


Stretch goals:

-text adventure demo 
-trash mob encounters


Notes:

-boss encounter is nearing "completion". Still feel some aspects are too frustrating to discover
-player might be under too much pressure to "experiment". a free observe command for hints might make it ok
-rpg combat really does feel like a "solved" problem when its 1-on-1. I've tried adding interesting hidden interactions,
 but I don't know how successful players will be at finding them. 
-will need to get real playtesting on friends for feedback soon.
