Command line demo of an rpg concept

To do:

-help, info commands
-name input
-unit tests?


Stretch goals:

-text adventure demo 
-trash mob encounters


Notes:

-boss encounter is nearing "completion". Still feel some aspects are too frustrating to discover
-player might be under too much pressure to "experiment". a free observe command for hints might make it ok

  Expanding on this, I think giving a (free) scouting action is the right way to go. Information is key.

-rpg combat really does feel like a "solved" problem when its 1-on-1. Solved for me at any rate.
-will need to get real playtesting on friends for feedback soon.

-on phase 3, if boss is distanced and about to charge, and player's health is lower than ignite dmg, they're screwed.
  
  possible solution: reduce self-inflicted damage from ignite?
